# JCOSMOS
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/JaeTLDR/jcosmos.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/JaeTLDR/jcosmos)
A simple easy to use cosmos db library.

# We Support hierachical Namespaces!
Though Microsoft has not documented this feature, we have added it, ensuring compatibility with the latest cosmos DB endpoints

## Does not support 
Currently Jcosmos is in the process of being written and only features basic operations, all documented endpoints will be included with exceptions listed below

exceptions 
- predefined S1, S2, S3 performance levels
- Resource Provider (will be added in the future, this requires azure auth token)

## Tests
Currently all methods have been tested manually, tests  will be written shortly and are greatly welcomed to be contributed.
